# IR_Sensor
Arduino Based IR sensor and Bluetooth controlled mobile application for Data accumulation and visualisation. 

## Objective 

The objective of this project was to develop a Arduino Based Infrared Sensor, a mobile application to control and visualise the data collected by the sensors. The project concluded with IR transimitivity and IR reflectivity data collection for various common mateirals.

This project was done under the guidance of **Dr. Mitradip Bhattacharjee, Assistant Professor, IISER Bhopal**.
